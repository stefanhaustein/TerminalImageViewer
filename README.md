# TerminalImageViewer (tiv)

Small C++ program to display images in a (modern) terminal 
using RGB ANSI codes and unicode block graphic characters.

There are various similar tools (such as `timg`) using the unicode half block character to display two 24bit pixels per character cell.
This program enhances the resolution by mapping 4x8 pixel cells to different unicode characters.

## Usage

    tiv [options] <filename(s)>

The shell will expand wildcards.
By default, thumbnails and file names will be displayed if more than one image is provided.
Without parameters, the program lists all available options.

## Installation

### Build from source

Debian/Ubuntu/RPM:
```sh
sudo apt install imagemagick || yum install ImageMagick
git clone https://github.com/stefanhaustein/TerminalImageViewer.git
cd TerminalImageViewer/src/main/cpp
make
sudo make install
```
Arch: Install `terminalimageviewer-git` from the AUR

### Homebrew (MacOS)

Option 1:
```
brew tap stefanhaustein/TerminalImageViewer https://github.com/stefanhaustein/TerminalImageViewer
brew install tiv
```
Option 2 (deprecated, for macOS Mojave and below):
```
brew tap stefanhaustein/TerminalImageViewer https://github.com/stefanhaustein/TerminalImageViewer
brew install terminalimageviewer
```
Option 3 (deprecated):
```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stefanhaustein/TerminalImageViewer/master/terminalimageviewer.rb
```

### Snap (outdated)

    sudo snap install --edge tiv

## Contributions

 - megamaced has created a RPM for SUSE:
   https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:megamaced/terminalimageviewer
 - bperel has created a Docker image:
   https://hub.docker.com/r/bperel/terminalimageviewer
 - teresaejunior has created a snapcraft.yaml file, which can build a Snap package with `sudo docker run -it --rm -v "$PWD:$PWD" -w "$PWD" snapcore/snapcraft sh -c 'apt-get update && snapcraft'`, and then installed with `sudo snap install --dangerous ./*.snap`.
 - aaronliu0130 has added brew support.

I am happy to accept useful contributions under the Apache 2.0 licencse, but...

 - Before investing in larger contributions, please use an issue to discuss this.
 - Pull requests should be as "atomic" as possible. I won't accept any pull request doing multiple things at once.
 - This library currently only depends on ImageMagic as an image processing library and I'd prefer to keep it that way.
 - Support for additional platforms, CPUs or similar will require somebody who is happy to help with maintenance, in particular,  if IÂ don't have access to it.

## Troubleshooting

 - On some linux platforms, an extra flag seems to be required: `make LDLIBS=-lstdc++fs` (but it also breaks MacOs),
   see  https://github.com/stefanhaustein/TerminalImageViewer/issues/103
 - If you see strange horizontal lines, the characters don't fully fill the character cell.
   Remove additional line spacing in your terminal app
 - Wrong colors? Try -256 to use a 256 color palette instead of 24 bit colors
 - Strange characters? Try -0 or install an use full unicode font (e.g. inconsolata or firacode)
 
## Algorithm

For each 4x8 pixel cell of the (potentially downscaled) image:

1. Find the color channel (R, G or B) that has the biggest range of values for the current cell.
2. Split this range in the middle and create a corresponding bitmap for the cell.
4. Compare the bitmap to the assumed bitmaps for various unicode block graphics characters.
5. Re-calculate the foreground and background colors for the chosen character.

See the difference by disabling this optimization using the `-0` option
or take a look at the comparison below.

If multiple images match the filename spec, thumbnails are shown.

### Comparison to Using Half-Block Characters Only

The top image was generated with the character optimization disabled via the `-0` option.
